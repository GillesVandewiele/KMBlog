            Continuous person monitoring systems usually assume singleperson households. Presence of visitors, such as family members and friends, and multi-person households are therefore not taken into consideration, although they can still influence results. However, in order to reason about a specific monitored person’s evolution and trends, it is needed to accurately recognise the different activities that these persons perform throughout a day. This paper considers multi-person households and focuses on the problem of assigning activities detected by a continuous monitoring system to the person that has performed these activities. The proposed solution consists of modelling the domain terminology into an ontology, as well as that person’s typical habits by means of a Finite State Machine – represented in its own ontology – using the concepts from the domain ontology. Sequences of recognized activities are then compared to the Finite State Machines associated to the different persons in a household, and assigned to the person with the most similar modelled sequence.
