  abstract     = {In 2013, the Flemish Government launched the Vitalink platform. This initiative focuses on the sharing of health and welfare data to support primary healthcare. In this paper, the objectives and mission of the Vitalink initiative are discussed. Security and privacy measures are reviewed, and the technical implementation of the Vitalink platform is presented. Through a case study, the possibility of interaction with cloud solutions for healthcare is also investigated upon; this was initially not the focus of Vitalink. The Vitalink initiative provides support for secure data sharing in primary healthcare, which in the long term will improve the efficiency of care and will decrease costs. Based on the results of the case study, Vitalink allowed cloud solutions or applications not providing end-to-end security to use their system. The most important lesson learned during this research was the need for firm regulations and stipulations for cloud solutions to interact with the Vitalink platform. However, these are currently still vague.},

  abstract     = {Background: Currently, healthcare services, such as institutional care facilities, are burdened with an increasing number of elderly people and individuals with chronic illnesses and a decreasing number of competent caregivers. Objectives: To relieve the burden on healthcare services, independent living at home could be facilitated, by offering individuals and their (in)formal caregivers support in their daily care and needs. With the rise of pervasive healthcare, new information technology solutions can assist elderly people ({\textacutedbl}residents{\textacutedbl}) and their caregivers to allow residents to live independently for as long as possible. Methods: To this end, the OCarePlatform system was designed. This semantic, data-driven and cloud based back-end system facilitates independent living by offering information and knowledge-based services to the resident and his/her (in)formal caregivers. Data and context information are gathered to realize context-aware and personalized services and to support residents in meeting their daily needs. This body of data, originating from heterogeneous data and information sources, is sent to personalized services, where is fused, thus creating an overview of the resident's current situation. Results: The architecture of the OCarePlatform is proposed, which is based on a service-oriented approach, together with its different components and their interactions. The implementation details are presented, together with a running example. A scalability and performance study of the OCarePlatform was performed. The results indicate that the OCarePlatform is able to support a realistic working environment and respond to a trigger in less than 5 seconds. The system is highly dependent on the allocated memory. Conclusion: The data-driven character of the OCarePlatform facilitates easy plug-in of new functionality, enabling the design of personalized, context-aware services. The OCarePlatform leads to better support for elderly people and individuals with chronic illnesses, who live independently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The European Data Portal shows a growing number of governmental organisations opening up transport data. As end users need traffic or transit updates on their day-to-day travels, route planners need access to this government data to make intelligent decisions. Developers however, will not integrate a dataset when the cost for adoption is too high. In this paper, the authors study the internal and technological challenges to publish data from the Department of Transport and Public Works in Flanders for maximum reuse. Using the qualitative Engage STakeholdErs through a systEMatic toolbox (ESTEEM) research approach, they interviewed 27 governmental data owners and organised both an internal workshop as a matchmaking workshop. In these workshops, data interoperability was discussed on four levels: legal, syntactic, semantic and querying. The interviews were summarised in ten challenges to which possible solutions were formulated. The effort needed to reuse existing public datasets today is high, yet they see the first evidence of datasets being reused in a legally and syntactically interoperable way. Publishing data so that it is reusable in an affordable way is still challenging.},

  abstract     = {In the Internet of Things (IoT), data-producing entities sense their environment and transmit these observations to a data processing platform for further analysis. Applications can have a notion of context awareness by combining this sensed data, or by processing the combined data. The processes of combining data can consist both of merging the dynamic sensed data, as well as fusing the sensed data with background and historical data. Semantics can aid in this task, as they have proven their use in data integration, knowledge exchange and reasoning. Semantic services performing reasoning on the integrated sensed data, combined with background knowledge, such as profile data, allow extracting useful information and support intelligent decision making. However, advanced reasoning on the combination of this sensed data and background knowledge is still hard to achieve. Furthermore, the collaboration between semantic services allows to reach complex decisions. The dynamic composition of such collaborative workflows that can adapt to the current context, has not received much attention yet. In this paper, we present MASSIF, a data-driven platform for the semantic annotation of and reasoning on IoT data. It allows the integration of multiple modular reasoning services that can collaborate in a flexible manner to facilitate complex decision-making processes. Data-driven workflows are enabled by letting services specify the data they would like to consume. After thorough processing, these services can decide to share their decisions with other consumers. By defining the data these services would like to consume, they can operate on a subset of data, improving reasoning efficiency. Furthermore, each of these services can integrate the consumed data with background knowledge in its own context model, for rapid intelligent decision making. To show the strengths of the platform, two use cases are detailed and thoroughly evaluated.},

  year         = {2017},
abstract = {On dense railway networks—such as in Belgium—train travelers are frequently confronted with overly occupied trains, especially during peak hours. Crowdedness on trains leads to a deterioration in the quality of service and has a negative impact on the well-being of the passenger. In order to stimulate travelers to consider less crowded trains, the iRail project wants to show an occupancy indicator in their route planning applications by the means of predictive modelling. As there is no official occupancy data available, training data is gathered by crowd sourcing using the Web app iRail.be and the Railer application for iPhone. Users can indicate their departure & arrival station, at what time they took a train and classify the occupancy of that train into the classes: low, medium or high. While preliminary results on a limited data set conclude that the models do not yet perform sufficiently well, we are convinced that with further research and a larger amount of data, our predictive model will be able to achieve higher predictive performances. All datasets used in the current research are, for that purpose, made publicly available under an open license on the iRail website and in the form of a Kaggle competition. Moreover, an infrastructure is set up that automatically processes new logs submitted by users in order for our model to continuously learn. Occupancy predictions for future trains are made available through an API.},

  abstract     = {Objectives: With the uprise of the Internet of Things, wearables and smartphones are moving to the foreground. Ambient Assisted Living solutions are, for example, created to facilitate ageing in place. One example of such systems are fall detection systems. Currently, there exists a wide variety of fall detection systems using different methodologies and technologies. However, these systems often do not take into account the fall handling process, which starts after a fall is identified or this process only consists of sending a notification. The FallRisk system delivers an accurate analysis of incidents occurring in the home of the older adults using several sensors and smart devices. Moreover, the input from these devices can be used to create a social aware event handling process, which leads to assisting the older adult as soon as possible and in the best possible way. 

Methods: The Fall Risk system consists of several components, located in different places. When an incident is identified by the FallRisk system, the event handling process will be followed to assess the fall incident and select the most appropriate caregiver, based on the input of the smartphones of the caregivers. In this process, availability and location are automatically taken into account. 

Results: The event handling process was evaluated during a decision tree workshop to verify if the current day practices reflect the requirements of all the stakeholders. Other knowledge, which is uncovered during this workshop can be taken into account to further improve the process. 

Conclusions: The FallRisk offers a way to detect fall incidents in an accurate way and uses context information to assign the incident to the most appropriate caregiver. This way, the consequences of the fall are minimized and help is at location as fast as possible. It could be concluded that the current guidelines on fall handling reflect the needs of the stakeholders. However, current technology evolutions, such as the uptake of wearables and smartphones, enables the improvement of these guidelines, such as the automatic ordering of the caregivers based on their location and availability.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the bed occupancy of an intensive care unit (ICU) is a daunting task. The uncertainty associated with the prognosis of critically ill patients and the random arrival of new patients can lead to capacity problems and the need for reactive measures. In this paper, we work towards a predictive model based on Random Survival Forests which can assist physicians in estimating the bed occupancy. As input data, we make use of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score collected and calculated from 4098 patients at two ICU units of Ghent University Hospital over a time period of four years. We compare the performance of our system with a baseline performance and a standard Random Forest regression approach. Our results indicate that Random Survival Forests can effectively be used to assist in the occupancy prediction problem. Furthermore, we show that a group based approach, such as Random Survival Forests, performs better compared to a setting in which the length of stay of a patient is individually assessed.},

  abstract     = {Semantic Web reasoning can be a complex task: depending on the amount of data and the ontologies involved, traditional OWL DL reasoners can be too slow to face problems in real time. An alternative is to use a rule-based reasoner together with the OWL RL/RDF rules as stated in the specification of the OWL 2 language profiles. In most cases this approach actually improves reasoning times, but due to the complexity of the rules, not as much as it could. In this paper we present an improved strategy: based on the TBoxes of the ontologies involved in a reasoning task, we create more specific rules which then can be used for further reasoning. We make use of the EYE reasoner and its logic Notation3. In this logic, rules can be employed to derive new rules which makes the rule creation a reasoning step on its own. We evaluate our implementation on a semantic nurse call system. Our results show that adding a pre-reasoning step to produce specialized rules improves reasoning times by around 75 \%.},

  abstract     = {The increasing elderly population and the shift from acute to chronic illness makes it difficult to care for people in hospitals and rest homes. Moreover, elderly people, if given a choice, want to stay at home as long as possible. In this article, the methodologies to develop a cloud-based semantic system, offering valuable information and knowledge-based services, are presented. The information and services are related to the different personal living hemispheres of the patient, namely the daily care-related needs, the social needs and the daily life assistance. Ontologies are used to facilitate the integration, analysis, aggregation and efficient use of all the available data in the cloud. By using an interdisciplinary research approach, where user researchers, (ontology) engineers, researchers and domain stakeholders are at the forefront, a platform can be developed of great added value for the patients that want to grow old in their own home and for their caregivers.},

  abstract     = {Traditionally, nurse call systems in hospitals are rather simple: patients have a button next to their bed to call a nurse. Which specific nurse is called cannot be controlled, as there is no extra information available. This is different for solutions based on semantic knowledge: if the state of care givers (busy or free), their current position, and for example their skills are known, a system can always choose the best suitable nurse for a call. In this paper we describe such a semantic nurse call system implemented using the EYE reasoner and Notation3 rules. The system is able to perform OWL-RL reasoning. Additionally, we use rules to implement complex decision trees. We compare our solution to an implementation using OWL-DL, the Pellet reasoner, and SPARQL queries. We show that our purely rule-based approach gives promising results. Further improvements will lead to a mature product which will significantly change the organization of modern hospitals.},

abstract = {Ontologies and reasoning algorithms are considered a promising approach to create decision making applications. Rule-based reasoning systems have the advantage that rule sets can be managed and applied separately, which facilitates the custom configuration of those systems. However, current implementations of rule-based reasoning systems usually introduce a trade-off between expressiveness and performance, which either deteriorates the configurability of the application, or limits its performance in an event-driven system. In this paper, we devise an event-driven rule-based reasoning system that preserves its expressiveness. We devise an automatic nurse call system that is able to handle hard time constraints without limiting the possibilities of the reasoner, and list the encountered problems together with their suggested solutions. We achieve reasonable performance in small-scale environments when evaluating this system using N3 rules and the EYE reasoner. We however observe that a large dynamic database limits the performance of the system, because of the file-based nature of the EYE reasoner. As long as no in-memory reasoning is supported, the performance of the resulting system cannot compete with the state of the art. However, the linear scaling of the proposed expressive solution is promising.},

The considered use case is the assignment of tasks and calls to nurses. To provide personalized and optimized care, the selection process utilizes reasoning to make intelligent assignment decisions based on the available information. This has been implemented using multiple SPARQL queries to enable easy adaptation of the assignment algorithm. Since limited time is available to perform the assignments, the decision should be made in at most five seconds. An analysis of the performance and scalability of the reasoners is presented. To deal with the limited time frame, several optimizations are suggested, which exploit that most of the ABox is considered static.},

  abstract     = {Background: The ultimate ambient-intelligent care room contains numerous sensors and devices to monitor the patient, sense and adjust the environment and support the staff. This sensor-based approach results in a large amount of data, which can be processed by current and future applications, e. g., task management and alerting systems. Today, nurses are responsible for coordinating all these applications and supplied information, which reduces the added value and slows down the adoption rate. The aim of the presented research is the design of a pervasive and scalable framework that is able to optimize continuous care processes by intelligently reasoning on the large amount of heterogeneous care data.
 
Methods: The developed Ontology-based Care Platform (OCarePlatform) consists of modular components that perform a specific reasoning task. Consequently, they can easily be replicated and distributed. Complex reasoning is achieved by combining the results of different components. To ensure that the components only receive information, which is of interest to them at that time, they are able to dynamically generate and register filter rules with a Semantic Communication Bus (SCB). This SCB semantically filters all the heterogeneous care data according to the registered rules by using a continuous care ontology. The SCB can be distributed and a cache can be employed to ensure scalability.
 
Results: A prototype implementation is presented consisting of a new-generation nurse call system supported by a localization and a home automation component. The amount of data that is filtered and the performance of the SCB are evaluated by testing the prototype in a living lab. The delay introduced by processing the filter rules is negligible when 10 or fewer rules are registered.
 
Conclusions: The OCarePlatform allows disseminating relevant care data for the different applications and additionally supports composing complex applications from a set of smaller independent components. This way, the platform significantly reduces the amount of information that needs to be processed by the nurses. The delay resulting from processing the filter rules is linear in the amount of rules. Distributed deployment of the SCB and using a cache allows further improvement of these performance results.},

@article{5782399,
  abstract     = {Current nurse call systems are very static. Call buttons are fixed to the wall, and systems do not account for various factors specific to a situation. We have developed a software platform, the ontology-based Nurse Call System (oNCS), which supports the transition to mobile and wireless nurse call buttons and uses an intelligent algorithm to address nurse calls. This algorithm dynamically adapts to the situation at hand by taking the profile information of staff and patients into account by using an ontology. This article describes a probabilistic extension of the oNCS that supports a more sophisticated nurse call algorithm by dynamically assigning priorities to calls based on the risk factors of the patient and the kind of call. The probabilistic oNCS is evaluated through implementation of a prototype and simulations, based on a detailed dataset obtained from 3 nursing departments of Ghent University Hospital. The arrival times of nurses at the location of a call, the workload distribution of calls among nurses, and the assignment of priorities to calls are compared for the oNCS and the current nurse call system. Additionally, the performance of the system and the parameters of the priority assignment algorithm are explored. The execution time of the nurse call algorithm is on average 50.333 ms. Moreover, the probabilistic oNCS significantly improves the assignment of nurses to calls. Calls generally result in a nurse being present more quickly, the workload distribution among the nurses improves, and the priorities and kinds of calls are taken into account.},

  abstract     = {Ontology engineering methodologies tend to emphasize the role of the knowledge engineer or require a very active role of domain experts. In this paper, a participatory ontology engineering method is described that holds the middle ground between these two 'extremes'. After thorough ethnographic research, an interdisciplinary group of domain experts closely interacted with ontology engineers and social scientists in a series of workshops. Once a preliminary ontology was developed, a dynamic care request system was built using the ontology. Additional workshops were organized involving a broader group of domain experts to ensure the applicability of the ontology across continuous care settings. The proposed method successfully actively engaged domain experts in constructing the ontology, without overburdening them. Its applicability is illustrated by presenting the co-created continuous care ontology. The lessons learned during the design and execution of the approach are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Emergency response applications require the processing of large amounts of data, generated by a diverse set of sensors and devices, in order to provide for an accurate and concise view of the situation at hand. The adoption of semantic technologies allows for the definition of a formal domain model and intelligent data processing and reasoning on this model based on generated device and sensor measurements. This paper presents a novel approach to emergency response applications, such as fire fighting, integrating a formal semantic domain model into an event-based decision support system, which supports reasoning on this model. The developed model consists of several generic ontologies describing concepts and properties which can be applied to diverse context-aware applications. These are extended with emergency response specific ontologies. Additionally, inference on the model performed by a reasoning engine is dynamically synchronized with the rest of the architectural components. This allows to automatically trigger events based on predefined conditions. The proposed ontology and developed reasoning methodology is validated on two scenarios, i.e. (i) the construction of an emergency response incident and corresponding scenario and (ii) monitoring of the state of a fire fighter during an emergency response.},

  abstract     = {The envisioned ambient-intelligent patient room contains numerous devices to sense and adjust the environment, monitor patients and support caregivers. Context-aware techniques are often used to combine and exploit the heterogeneous data offered by these devices to improve the provision of continuous care. However, the adoption of context-aware applications is lagging behind what could be expected, because they are not adapted to the daily work practices of the users, a lack of personalization of the services and not tackling problems such as the need of the users for control. To mediate this, an interdisciplinary methodology was investigated and designed in this research to involve the users in each step of the development cycle of the context-aware application. The methodology was used to develop an ambient-intelligent nurse call system, which uses gathered context data to find the most appropriate caregivers to handle a call of a patient and generate new calls based on sensor data. Moreover, a smartphone application was developed for the caregivers to receive and assess calls. The lessons learned during the user-driven development of this system are highlighted.},

  abstract     = {The use of semantic technology has recently witnessed a huge increase. One of the areas in which this technology is being used increasingly more often is that of context-aware agents. However, the use of ontologies in general and reasoning in particular can rapidly become resource intensive. Certainly if the data set, called the A-Box, used by these agents grows considerably over time. Moreover, in order to create context-aware applications, taking into account a wide range of different data sets and context parameters, agents have to be provided to expose that data. The collaboration between the agents in the system is necessary to correlate the information and augment the intelligence and added value of the context-aware agents. Therefore, there is a need to have a distributed approach by means of a service-platform, where the different agents in a context-aware environment can collaborate. The main focus of this article is on the research on the design of a service-platform for semantic ontology-based context-aware collaboration. The platform architecture to allow the collaboration and scheduling, together with the associated algorithms, will be presented. The engineering and implementation details will be highlighted. By means of detailed UML sequence diagrams, we will present the workflow and collaboration between the different modules in the platform. Additionally, supporting developments, such as the meta-ontology and our ontology generator, OTAGen, will be presented. Furthermore, we will detail how the platform can operate in an autonomous way, taking into account the changing context of the agents in the platform.},

  abstract     = {Background: The current, place-oriented nurse call systems are very static. A patient can only make calls with a button which is fixed to a wall of a room. Moreover, the system does not take into account various factors specific to a situation. In the future, there will be an evolution to a mobile button for each patient so that they can walk around freely and still make calls. The system would become person-oriented and the available context information should be taken into account to assign the correct nurse to a call. The aim of this research is (1) the design of a software platform that supports the transition to mobile and wireless nurse call buttons in hospitals and residential care and (2) the design of a sophisticated nurse call algorithm. This algorithm dynamically adapts to the situation at hand by taking the profile information of staff members and patients into account. Additionally, the priority of a call probabilistically depends on the risk factors, assigned to a patient.
Methods: The ontology-based Nurse Call System (oNCS) was developed as an extension of a Context-Aware Service Platform. An ontology is used to manage the profile information. Rules implement the novel nurse call algorithm that takes all this information into account. Probabilistic reasoning algorithms are designed to determine the priority of a call based on the risk factors of the patient.
Results: The oNCS system is evaluated through a prototype implementation and simulations, based on a detailed dataset obtained from Ghent University Hospital. The arrival times of nurses at the location of a call, the workload distribution of calls amongst nurses and the assignment of priorities to calls are compared for the oNCS system and the current, place-oriented nurse call system. Additionally, the performance of the system is discussed.
Conclusions: The execution time of the nurse call algorithm is on average 50.333 ms. Moreover, the oNCS system significantly improves the assignment of nurses to calls. Calls generally have a nurse present faster and the workload-distribution amongst the nurses improves.},

@article{986862,
  abstract     = {Background: Computerized ICUs rely on software services to convey the medical condition of their patients as well as assisting the staff in taking treatment decisions. Such services are useful for following clinical guidelines quickly and accurately. However, the development of services is often time-consuming and error-prone. Consequently, many care-related activities are still conducted based on manually constructed guidelines. These are often ambiguous, which leads to unnecessary variations in treatments and costs. The goal of this paper is to present a semi-automatic verification and translation framework capable of turning manually constructed diagrams into ready-to-use programs. This framework combines the strengths of the manual and service-oriented approaches while decreasing their disadvantages. The aim is to close the gap in communication between the IT and the medical domain. This leads to a less time-consuming and error-prone development phase and a shorter clinical evaluation phase.
Methods: A framework is proposed that semi-automatically translates a clinical guideline, expressed as an XML-based flow chart, into a Drools Rule Flow by employing semantic technologies such as ontologies and SWRL. An overview of the architecture is given and all the technology choices are thoroughly motivated. Finally, it is shown how this framework can be integrated into a service-oriented architecture (SOA).
Results: The applicability of the Drools Rule language to express clinical guidelines is evaluated by translating an example guideline, namely the sedation protocol used for the anaesthetization of patients, to a Drools Rule Flow and executing and deploying this Rule-based application as a part of a SOA. The results show that the performance of Drools is comparable to other technologies such as Web Services and increases with the number of decision nodes present in the Rule Flow. Most delays are introduced by loading the Rule Flows.
Conclusions: The framework is an effective solution for computerizing clinical guidelines as it allows for quick development, evaluation and human-readable visualization of the Rules and has a good performance. By monitoring the parameters of the patient to automatically detect exceptional situations and problems and by notifying the medical staff of tasks that need to be performed, the computerized sedation guideline improves the execution of the guideline.},

  abstract     = {The ICU of Ghent University Hospital is currently evaluating a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that supports physicians in the follow-up of patients by providing a number of medical support services. The main idea behind SOA is the separation of the functions of the system into well-defined, independent, reusable and distributable services. However, sometimes physicians require a more specific or slightly different functionality than the existing services offer. In these situations the system architecture imposes the time-consuming and error-prone development and testing of a new service.
To counter this, a framework was developed that integrates a Rule-based component with the existing SOA platform. This allows users to add new functionalities as easy understandable Rules. This integration can be constructed in two ways. In the database-driven approach the Rule-based system is an extra layer between the database and the services. The service-oriented approach, on the other hand, works with the data provided by the services and does not interact directly with the database.
Both approaches are detailed and compared to each other. Both solutions were evaluated with a medical use case, namely detecting Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) in patients in the ICU.},

  abstract     = {Context information is becoming increasingly important in a world with more and more wireless devices that have to be in touch with the environment around them. In this paper, we focus on how this context information can be efficiently modelled by employing an ontology. This ontology can then be used by reasoning algorithms (e.g., Rules) which are based on this context information. This way, the algorithm is more sensitive to the varying conditions of the environment. This is illustrated with a use case which studies the transition from a place-oriented to a person-oriented nurse call system. The Context-aware Service Platform (CASP) context framework (Strobbe et al., 2007; 2006) was extended to implement the use case. A web service interface was designed which allows the insertion or extraction of new information into the Knowledge Base. Finally, a simulation was set up to illustrate the advantages and the performance of the new person-oriented approach.},

  abstract     = {In this paper the focus is on how context information can be efficiently modeled with an ontology This ontology can than be used by reasoning algorithms which are based on this context information. This is illustrated with a use case which studies the evolution from a place oriented to a person oriented nurse call system.
An ontology was designed which holds the necessary context information. A nurse call algorithm that uses this information was constructed. The CASP Context framework was extended to implement the use case. This framework is bases on an OSGi framework. Rules are formulated to implement the algorithm. OWL was applied to integrate the ontology into the framework. A Web Service interface was designed which allows to insert new information into the Knowledge Base or extract information from it. At last a simulation was set up to show the advantages of the person oriented approach. The results of a performance study are shown as well.},

  abstract = {The current nurse call systems are organised according to rooms:  each room (or bed) has a button that can be used by the patients to call a nurse. In the future, there will be an evolution to a button for each patient so that they can walk around freely and still make calls. This signifies the transition from a place oriented to a person oriented system. In this thesis a person oriented nurse call system is described.  An ontology was designed that holds the necessary context information.  A nurse call algorithm that uses this information was constructed. The IBCN Context framework was used to implement the whole. Rules are formulated to implement the algorithm. OWL and Jena were applied to integrate the ontology in the framework. A couple of Web services were set up. They allow us to insert new information into the knowledge base or extract information from it.  At last a simulation was set up to show the advantages of the personoriented approach},
