<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>The DISKOVER team performs research on harnessing data to create more <strong>intelligent systems</strong>.  More and more data is being generated today. However, raw data is meaningless. It needs to be combined with <strong>expert and domain knowledge</strong> in order to derive or predict interesting events from the data streams. To allow for <strong>real-time decision making</strong> based on  these events, this analysis should be performed in a performant and scalable manner. Moreover, the constructed algorithms should be <strong>interpretable</strong> such that domain experts can understand why the system suggests a particular decision. To support this, we are  performing research into novel algorithms to perform this analysis more accurately and effectively, including techniques such as <strong>semantic reasoning</strong> (logic-based, Semantic Web, etc.), <strong>white-box machine learning</strong> (decision trees, finite state machines, etc.), <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> and <strong>fusion of semantics and machine learning</strong>. </p>
<p>These techniques are applied to a number of application areas, such as smart factories, personalized robotics, smart cities, etc. Three application areas are receiving most attention due to their possible societal impact, i.e., eHealth, VR and IoT.</p>
<p><strong>Ehealth</strong>: Since a number of years, the complexity of institutional care settings has been increasing due to societal factors such as the growth of the care unit size, the more specialized nature of care and the reduction in staff levels. This requires a more optimized ruse of resources. Decision support systems can help greatly in this to give early warnings signs of detected diseases and complications and suggest treatment options. Moreover, a trend can also be noticed towards putting more focus on encouraging healthy lifestyles and performing care at the home of the patient. Mobile applications, combined with gamification techniques, can offer a great support towards motivating the people and monitoring their daily life. </p>
<p><strong>VR</strong>: The Virtual Reality research focuses on two challenges, real-time decision-making and personalization &amp; context-awareness. By means of real-time decision-making it is possible to decide what type of content to show or which action to take. In addition, personalization and context-awareness enables to tailor actions according to the specific needs of the user and the environment. A plethora of user-cases can be thought of, such as VR video streaming, automatic 3D content generation or information overlay for Augmented Reality.</p>
<p><strong>IoT</strong>: In recent years, there is an increasing interest in internet connected devices &amp; sensors, called the Internet of Things (IoT). These IoT devices constantly generate data that describe their state and the state of the context or environment they are in. Information available on social media and observations &amp; measurements provided by people also amount to a wealth of data describing the physical world. The advantage of IoT is that these data streams originating from various sources can be combined &amp; processed to derive high-level conclusions about the environment, the profile of the user and the current situation. This enables devices &amp; applications to achieve situation- and context-awareness, allows advanced monitoring of the environment and better support of human users in their daily activities.</p>
